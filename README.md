# My GIMP settings

To make gimp bit more like Photoshop and bit better.

## ./settings/
Directory containing settings.
After installing GIMP on local machine, in windows explorer open %APPDATA%\Gimp and go to directory named after current GIMP version 
Paste content of /settings/ in this repo into that directory.
These settings were originally created for GIMP 2.10.22.
